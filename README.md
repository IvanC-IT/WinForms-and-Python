# WinForms-and-Python
Display output Python and view it in a WinForm application:
This tool get the output of a Python script and the ability to view it in a WinForm application. I  created an application that allows you to choose a Python script from your file system or to type a basic script directly into the module. There are no fancy editor tools in the module, but someone could easily take this application and extend it into a small Python editor if they wish.
